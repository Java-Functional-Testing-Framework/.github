Welcome to our **Java Functional Testing Framework** (**JFTF**) GitHub organization!

Our framework is a complete test automation solution that provides a library for building functional test case applications that can be deployed on containerized targets. Additionally, it provides a control application that can be used to manage test reports, plan test case executions, and more. 

We understand that testing can be a tedious and time-consuming process. That's why our framework is designed with functional testing in mind and aims to make the testing process as seamless as possible for our users. With our framework, you can easily test the functionality of your system and ensure that they meet your business requirements.
